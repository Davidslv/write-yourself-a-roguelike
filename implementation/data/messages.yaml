intro: "It is written in the Book of %d:

    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.

Your %G %d seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.

You, a newly trained %r, have been heralded
from birth as the instrument of %d.  You are destined
to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the
attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake
of us all:  Go bravely with %d!"
